# Unit Testing-Koans

The sub folders contain [Testing Koans](https://blog.code-cop.org/2015/12/testing-koans.html) to understand how to write unit tests with different frameworks.

## Assignment

* Run tests according the testing tool.
* You should see some test failures and errors (but there are no assertions).
* Go through the test code starting from Session 1:
  * All assertions are commented and incomplete.
  * Uncomment the assertions and complete them making the tests pass.
  * You can run individual sessions according the testing tool.
