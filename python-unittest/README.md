# Python-Unittest-Koans #

Python [Testing Koans](http://blog.code-cop.org/2015/12/testing-koans.html) to understand how to write unit tests with [unittest](https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html).

## Assignment ##

* TODO change test for running tests
* This project supports both [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org).
* This is a [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) project.
* Running either `mvnw test` or `gradlew test`, you should see some test failures and errors (but there are no assertions).
* Run `phpunit` (or `vendor/bin/phpunit`), you should see no tests.
* Go through the test code starting from Session 1:
    * All assertions are commented and incomplete.
    * Uncomment the assertions and complete them making the tests pass.
    * You can run individual sessions using `mvnw test -Dtest=*1*`
